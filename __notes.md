# Notes

## Channel setup

Identical FX on each channel

Macros named to match mapped devices

Macros and Devices ordered left to right

Easy enough to jump into the device tweak a delay or reverb

nanoKONTROL pans mapped to Utility balance rather than track pan to see important info at a glance in FX view.

But send knobs might not be recappable to eqs?

"It feels like a bit of a missed opportunity that the Send knobs can't be used to control device parameters like the Pan knobs can, but that's certainly not enough of an issue to prevent us giving it our wholehearted recommendation."
