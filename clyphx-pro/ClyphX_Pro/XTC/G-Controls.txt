#********************************** [SETTINGS] *****************************************

# Below you can specify a list of MIDI Buttons to use as G-Controls as well as the Action
# Lists they should trigger when various gestures are received. The MIDI Buttons you
# specify here are expected to be momentary (send an on message when pressed and an
# off message when released).

# The entry format for each control is:
# NAME = TYPE, CHANNEL, NOTE_OR_CC, OFF_LED, ON_LED, REPEAT

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ENTRY      |  DESCRIPTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | NAME       |  A unique one-word name for the control.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | TYPE       |  The type of MIDI message the control sends (NOTE or CC).
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | CHANNEL    |  The MIDI Channel number in the range of 1-16.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | NOTE_OR_CC |  The Note or CC number in the range of 0-127.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | OFF_LED    |  The LED value in the range of 0-127 to use by default and when the
# |            |  control is not pressed down. If in doubt, use 0.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ON_LED     |  The LED value in the range of 0-127 to use when the control is pressed
# |            |  down. If in doubt, use 127.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | REPEAT     |  TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the control should repeatedly trigger
# |            |  an Action List when it's pressed down.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example: MY_BTN1 = NOTE, 1, 10, 0, 127, TRUE


# After each control specification, you'll list the gestures you want to listen for and
# the Action List that should be triggered when the gesture is received.

# The entry format for each gesture is:
# NAME GESTURE_TYPE = ACTION_LIST

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ENTRY        |  DESCRIPTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | NAME         |  The name specified for the control
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | GESTURE_TYPE |  The type of gesture to listen for.  These types are listed below.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ACTION_LIST  |  The Action List to trigger when the gesture is received.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example: MY_BTN1 PRESSED = METRO


#******************************** [GESTURE TYPES] ***************************************

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | TYPE                 |  DESCRIPTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | PRESSED              |  Received when the control is pressed. The Action List
# |                      |  specified for this gesture is the one that will be repeated
# |                      |  when REPEAT is TRUE.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | PRESSED_DELAYED      |  Received when the control is pressed down for 500 ms or more.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | RELEASED             |  Received when the control is released. This will be received
# |                      |  any time the control is released and will be received before
# |                      |  the next two gesture types.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | RELEASED_IMMEDIATELY |  Received when the control is released after being pressed
# |                      |  down for less than 500 ms.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | RELEASED_DELAYED     |  Received when the control is released after being pressed
# |                      |  down for 500 ms or more.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Below is an example list that has been commented out (the # at the beginning of
# a line makes the line a comment). Your list should be formatted in the same way
# except without the # at the beginning of each line.

# B1 = NOTE, 9, 9, 25, 52, FALSE
# B1 PRESSED = MUTE
# B1 RELEASED_DELAYED = MUTE

# B2 = CC, 1, 1, 0, 127, TRUE
# B2 PRESSED = VOL <5
# B2 RELEASED = VOL RESET


# When using long Action Lists, it's possible to split the Action List up over multiple
# lines.  This requires that each additional line is indented by 1 space.

# B1 PRESSED = MON;
#  ARM;
#  NAME "My Track"

# XTC (Midi Fighter Twister B) - G-Controls
# Track names are for reference only
# CC numbers reference those assigned in the Midi Fighter Utility

# PRESSED_DELAYED is a workaround for the broken 'Shift Encoder Hold' functionality of the MFT
# See https://forum.djtechtools.com/showthread.php?t=951222

# Encoder default = VU meter (Encoder Bindings)
